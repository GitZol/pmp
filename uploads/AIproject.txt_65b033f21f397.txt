transfer learning
alexnet // trained for animals and objects
fine tuning network on new dataset
uses softmax classifier
(look for better classifiers)

transformer arc

auto enconders // not trained on a specific datasets, remove noise, generative model
summarises features
dont need labelling
reconstructs input



xgboost or different classification

compete with pre trained model

feature engineering


The Task: Use Convolutional autoencoder (their codes to add shallow ML (i.e., SVM, RF and Xgboost). Please apply this on CiFAR100 (try to beat the benchmark, 96)
